Revision history for Data-Schema

0.10    2009-11-09
        - new: type attribute 'deps' for HasElement types, specifying
          interelement dependencies.
        - new: type 'cistr' (case-insensitive string)

0.09    2009-11-08
        - now requires Data::PrefixMerge 0.06
        - new: type attribute 'forbidden' (the opposite of 'required'), which
          states that data must be undef
        - new: type attribute 'set' which is just an alias for 'required' or
          'forbidden'. set=1 is the same as setting 'required=1', while 'set=0'
          is the same as 'forbidden=0'
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: setting config is now done via
          $validator->config->foo instead of $validator->config->{foo} to catch
          config name typos at compile time.
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: when a hash type has 'keys' attribute, it now
          automatically means that only those keys specified in 'keys' are
          allowed (i.e. [hash=>{keys: {a: int, b: str, c: int}}] now
          automatically means [hash=>{keys: {a: int, b: str, c: int},
          allowed_keys: [a, b, c]}]. this is because it is the common case
          anyway. to get the old behaviour, you need to set configuration:
          'allow_extra_hash_keys' to true.
