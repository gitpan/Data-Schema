Data::Schema::Manual::TypeHandler - Writing type handler for Data::Schema


=head1 OVERVIEW

This document explains how to write type handler using Perl.


=head1 INTRODUCTION

Type handler allows DS to recognize and validate a new type.

Any object can become a type handler as long as it satisfies these requirements:

1. It has a validator([$validator]) method to retrieve/set the validator
property.

2. It has cmp() method.

2. Define handle_pre_check_attrs() method.

3. Define handle_type() method.

4. Define zero or more handle_attr_*() methods.

It is usually more convenient to subclass from L<Data::Schema::Type::Base> so
you are relieved from many of these tasks, unless you are creating some exotic
type. With Data::Schema::Type::Base, you usually need to override
handle_pre_check_attrs() and write some handle_attr_*() methods.

=head1 API

=head2 cmp($a, $b)

Called by DST::Base's various handle_attr_*() methods to allow subclass to
provide comparison function. Should return -1, 0, 1 a la Perl's cmp() or undef
if comparison is undefined for the type.

=head2 handle_pre_check_attrs($data)

Called by DST::Base's handle_type() to give a chance to subclass to inspect the
data whether its value is acceptable for the type.

=head2 handle_type($data, $attr_hashes)

Called by the validator's _validate() method. $attr_hashes is an arrayref of
attribute hash. Each attribute hash is a mapping attribute name and values.

Should return 1 when succesful or 0 if fails. If there are errors, please log
them using $validator->log_error().;

=head2 handle_attr_NAME($data, $arg)

This is called by DST::Base's handle_type() when encountering type
attribute of name=NAME in the attribute hashes. This makes it convenient to
support new attribute, by just adding a method with the appropriate name.

Should return 1 when succesful or 0 if fails. If there are errors, please log
them using $validator->log_error().;


=head1 USING YOUR NEW TYPE

To use your new type, register it via:

 $validator->register_type('Your::Class');

or

 $validator->register_type($your_obj);
